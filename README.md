This Python code implements a basic task management system using object-oriented programming and datetime operations. The code defines a Task class to represent individual tasks with attributes such as title, priority, and due date. The system allows users to add tasks to a list, display the list of tasks, and remove tasks based on their index.

Key Components:
Task Class:
Represents a task with attributes: title, priority, and due date.

add_task Function:
Appends a task to the list of tasks.

display_tasks Function:
Prints details of tasks in the list, including title, priority, and due date.

remove_task Function:
Removes a task from the list based on the provided index.

Main Execution:
Initializes a list 'tasks_list' and creates sample tasks.
Adds tasks to the list, displays them, adds a new task, displays the updated list, and removes a task based on user input.

Note: The code incorporates the datetime module for handling due dates and timedelta for date arithmetic.
